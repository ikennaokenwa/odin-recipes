    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Black-eyed peas</li>
      <li>Cray Fish</li>
      <li>Spices</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak the beans in room temperature water for about 15 to 20 minutes
        until the skin is swollen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the water and place the beans in the food processor. Pulse the
        food processor a few times to remove the skin from the beans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the beans into a large bowl, add enough water, and gently swirl the
        beans around so the skin can float. Discard the skin into a colander.
        Repeat this process until the beans are clean.
      </li>

      <li>
        Pour the clean beans into a blender, add the water, red bell pepper,
        habanero pepper, salt, bouillon powder, and crayfish, and blend until
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter into a large bowl and whisk it until its light and
        fluffy hand whisk for about 3 to 4 minutes, or use an electric hand
        mixer for about a minute or two.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the finely diced onion and gently fold with a wooden spoon or
        spatula in one direction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat some oil (enough to fry the Akara) in a pan on medium to high heat.
        Drop heaping tablespoons of batter into the hot oil, frying in batches
        to prevent overcrowding. Flip once or twice to ensure even browningâ€”fry
        the Akara for about five to six minutes, or until golden brown on all
        sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before removing any Akara from the oil, gently press them down to remove
        any excess oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the Akara from the pan and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with bread, pap, oatmeal, yogurt, or other desired side.</li>
    </ol>
