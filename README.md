# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This is a basic HTML website that displays a collection of recipes. The project is structured to build fundamental web development skills, particularly in HTML and website structuring. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated an ability to create HTML pages, manage directories, utilize basic tags, and link multiple pages together.

## Project Structure

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure

- **Task**: Set up the main directory and initial HTML file.
- **Actions**:
  - Create an `index.html` file within the `odin-recipes` directory.
  - Fill `index.html` with standard HTML boilerplate.
  - Add an `<h1>` heading titled "Odin Recipes".

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page

- **Task**: Create a subdirectory for recipes and add individual recipe pages.
- **Actions**:
  - Create a `recipes` directory inside `odin-recipes`.
  - Inside `recipes`, create an HTML file named after a specific recipe (e.g., `lasagna.html`).
  - Insert an `<h1>` tag with the recipeâ€™s name in each recipe file.
  - Add a link in `index.html` under the `<h1>` heading to the new recipe page.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

- **Task**: Add detailed content to each recipe page.
- **Actions**:
  - Add an image of the dish right under the `<h1>` heading.
  - Include a "Description" heading followed by a paragraph describing the dish.
  - List the ingredients under an "Ingredients" heading using an unordered list.
  - Detail the cooking steps under a "Steps" heading using an ordered list.

### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

- **Task**: Expand the website with more recipes.
- **Actions**:
  - Add two additional recipes with the same structure as the first.
  - Update `index.html` to include links to all recipes, ideally within an unordered list for better organization.

## Skills Demonstrated

Upon completion of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- Basic HTML syntax and structure.
- Creating and managing directories and files within a project.
- Implementing navigation between pages using hyperlinks.
- Structuring content using HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

This project is part of my learning journey with The Odin Project, focusing on the fundamentals of web development.
